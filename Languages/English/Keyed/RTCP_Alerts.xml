  <SPTT_TrackerAlert_descr>SPT stands for Session Play Time.

A session begins when you start a new game, load a save, or join a multiplayer session; and ends when you Quit to OS, Quit to Main Menu, or leave a multiplayer session.

Hosting a new multiplayer session or converting a multiplayer world back to singleplayer does not reset the session.

This timer tells you how much time you have spent in this session.

You may want to avoid playing long sessions of RimWorld.</SPTT_TrackerAlert_descr>
