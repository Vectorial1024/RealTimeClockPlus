  <SPTT_TrackerAlert_descr>SPT stands for Session Play Time.

A session begins when you start a new game or load a save, and ends when you Quit to OS or Quit to Main Menu.

This timer tells you how much time you have spent in this session.

You may want to avoid playing long sessions of RimWorld.</SPTT_TrackerAlert_descr>
