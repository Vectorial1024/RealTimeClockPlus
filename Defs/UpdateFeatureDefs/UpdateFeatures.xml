		<content>Greetings, mod user. Thank you for using &lt;color=cyan&gt;Desynchronized&lt;/color&gt;, a WIP mod that aims to change how Colonists react to the outside world.|The only change in this update is that &lt;color=cyan&gt;Desynchronized&lt;/color&gt; now requires HugsLib, which is also the reason why you are reading this right now.|Stay safe, report bugs, and have fun!</content>

		<content>A slightly overdue update! But who cares; at least we got this mod updated. Yay!|&lt;b&gt;Implemented Mandatory Censorship Scheme&lt;/b&gt;
The Scheme filteres information about the following events that originate from outside the Colonists' home-base:|- Executions, Organ Harvests, and Banishments
- Prisoners Sold
- Colonist Died and associated thoughts|Note that the vanilla game has already implemented a similar Scheme to filter the following events:|- Know Butchered Human
- Buried in Sarcophagus
- Colonist Left Unburied.|&lt;b&gt;On a more serious note:&lt;/b&gt;
- Reduced Steam Workshop file size thanks to PublisherPlus
- Changing the direction of this mod from a simple, low-level "Gulag mod" to a complex, high-level "Censorship mod"|That's all! Stay safe, report bugs, and have fun!</content>

		<content>Weekly update. Version 1.2 will focus on Colonists' reactions towards kidnaps in raids. Don't you realize that colonists won't have any thoughts whatsoever when someone is kidnapped?|- Added new Thought: Colonist Kidnapped (Stacks 5 times, with -2/-3/-4/-5/-6)
- More kidnap-related thoughts to come in later v1.2.* updates|I have also implemented a script that logs the Tales of kidnapped Colonists onto your desktop when DevMode is turned on. This will be useful later when I start to implement the Information Barricade.|That's all! Stay safe, report bugs, and have fun!</content>

		<content>I originally planned to upload a holiday special v1.2.2 a few days ago, but couldn't make it, so now, we have this huge update to Desynchronized: the version 1.3.0!|- Major rewrite of underlying code to conform to the "information system" standard
- Effects of existing features are unchanged
- Kidnaps: now has all the family-relation Thoughts like "my grandfather was kidnapped", "my cousin was kidnapped" etc.
- Banishment: new placeholder letter for when you banish a Colonist
- Executions: new placeholder letter for when you execute a Colonist/Guest (Prisoners are technically Guests)
- Organ Harvests: no new features (i.e., should work just as before)
- Slight (maybe non-noticable) optimization: game no longer attempts to give out thoughts when pawns are downed
- Fixed bug: Colonists should now not know about Executions happening outside of their home map (for real this time)|Click on the link above to visit the GitHub online repo, where you can find the source code, previous versions, and detailed changelogs.</content>

		<content>Version 1.3.1 is here to restructure the mod in preparation to implement the "information system". And I have already decided the name of that system too. And college is resuming soon, too...|- Most code has been rewritten in compliance to the new standard
- Internal logic update: executions are now considered as another form of death
- Fixed bug: banishing a bonded animal should now correctly give Bonded Animal Banished instead of Colonist Banished (oh lol)|Click on the link above to visit the GitHub online repo, where you can find the source code, previous versions, and detailed changelogs.</content>

- (Residue bugs from previous version's savefile may still be around, but should be less severe)
- Included "Prisoner/Colonist sold" into the "information system"
- Fixed bug: Gifting Colonists to Factions via drop-pods should now give mood debuff; this debuff applies to those in the map where the pods were launched
- Fixed bug: Bloodlust pawns should no longer get "Killed Someone" when they kill animals
- Flavour texts for "Colonist Kidnapped" and related Thoughts now open for translation|Click on the link above to visit the GitHub online repo, where you can find the source code, previous versions, and detailed changelogs.</content>

		<content>It's finally here: Version 1.4. After 2 months in development, I am proud to announce that we have reached a major milestone of development: the completion of the news-spreading system.|- New concept: Tale-News (TN). A TN is a representation of an in-game event that has occured. The list of in-game events that can be represented by  the TN system will be expanded in the future as development continues. Details are on GitHub.
- New behavior: TN spreading. When doing chit-chat and deep-talk, the initiator has a small chance to tell the recipient one entry of TN. Details are on GitHub.
- New settings: You have the option to disable the TN-spreading behavior (which is enabled by default). Consult your Mod Settings for details.
- Known issue: (Steam only) Mod size boomed back up to 20MB. PublisherPlus died after the recent RimWorld update.|Many thanks to the cumulative 7000 subscribers of this mod! Your support has propelled me forward even when times are tough, to encourage me to finish what I started.|And also, 新年快樂!

- New trait spectrum related to NST: Gossiper (+0.03 NST) and Secret-keeper (-0.015 NST). This trait spectrum is less common than average.
- Fixed bug: pawns trying to spread news will no longer have 50% chance to throw ArgumentOutOfRangeException.
- (Steam only) An attempt was made to reduce mod file size (from ~27 MB to ~15 MB)|If you would like to include your error logs when reporting bugs, please use PasteBin ( https://pastebin.com/ )|Click on the link above to visit the GitHub online repo, where you can find the source code, previous versions, detailed changelogs and elaboration of features.</content>
