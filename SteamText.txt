[h1]Mod Description[/h1]
This mod is made in response to a feature request on the Reddit suggestion thread.

As of v2.0.0, this mod is now made of two modules:
[list]
[*]Real Time Clock Readout: Display formats for your real-time clock
[*]Session Play Time Tracker: In-game play-time tracker
[/list]
Further information on each module can be found in the Mod Options menu.

As of v3.0.0, the Play Time Tracker only counts time that RimWorld is focused, meaning that when the game is minimized or the computer is put to sleep, the Tracker is paused.

As of v4.0.0, this mod was made compatible with the v1.1 new Harmony library.

[h1]Real Time Clock Readout[/h1]
You may change the display format of your real-time clock. Currently, these formats are offered:
[list]
[*]HH:MM (24-hours) (game default)
[*]HH:MM (12-hours)
[*]HH:MM:SS (24-hours)
[*]HH:MM:SS (12-hours)
[/list]
[h1]Session Play Time Tracker[/h1]
Inherited from the now-discontinued mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1655335839]Play Time Tracker[/url], you may now see a timer that shows how many time you have spent in your current RimWorld session. It has a color gradient (gradient can be disabled), configured as follows:
[list]
[*]Green (at 0%, 0 hours)
[*]Yellow (at 40%, 2 hours)
[*]Red (at 70%, 3.5 hours)
[*]Black (at 100%+, 5 hours+)
[/list]
[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
[list]
[*]The Session Play Time Tracker alert is not exactly accurate, in the sense that sometimes, you notice it takes more than 1 seconds to change the value to another second; this is a limitation of RimWorld, where contents inside unfocused alerts are updated less frequently.
[/list]
[h1]Join Our Cause! 出一分力吧！[/h1]
I am not sure what kinds of time formats this community wants, so I am welcoming fellow players to suggest additional clock formats for me to put into this mod as one of the available options.
我們十分歡迎各位建議更多的時鐘顯示方式。留個言吧！

Thanks to u/Generalkrunk on Reddit for suggesting this idea.
